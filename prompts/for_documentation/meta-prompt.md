# COMPREHENSIVE COBOL ANALYSIS PIPELINE - ACAS SYSTEM

## Overview
Execute a four-phase analysis pipeline to completely document, analyze, and prepare the ACAS (Applewood Computers Accounting System) COBOL codebase for modernization. Each phase builds upon the previous, creating increasingly sophisticated analysis and documentation.

## System Context
- **Application**: ACAS - Complete ERP with GL, AR/AP, Stock Control, and IRS modules
- **Technology**: GnuCOBOL with file-based storage and partial MySQL/MariaDB
- **Scale**: 278 programs, 175 copybooks, 500K+ lines of code
- **Age**: 45+ years of continuous operation and enhancement

## EXECUTION PHASES:

### Step 1: COBOL Structure Extraction and Parsing
**Prompt**: `1_parser_prompt.md`
**Input**: `Legacy_App/` (all COBOL source files)
**Output**: `documentation/parsed/`

**Objectives**:
- Parse 100% of COBOL programs and copybooks
- Extract complete program structure (all divisions)
- Map all dependencies (CALL, COPY, PERFORM)
- Calculate initial complexity metrics
- Create JSON representation of entire codebase

**Key Deliverables**:
- `parsed-structures/` - Individual JSON files per program
- `parser-summary.json` - Complete inventory and statistics
- Dependency graph data
- Error log for any parsing issues

### Step 2: Deep Code Analysis and Visualization
**Prompt**: `2_parsed_analysis_prompt.md`
**Input**: 
- `Legacy_App/` (for validation)
- `documentation/parsed/parsed-structures/`
- `documentation/parsed/parser-summary.json`
**Output**: `documentation/parsed/parser_analysis/`

**Objectives**:
- Generate interactive visualizations of system architecture
- Calculate advanced metrics (Halstead, Maintainability Index)
- Identify code quality issues and technical debt
- Create searchable documentation
- Build metrics database for queries

**Key Deliverables**:
- `visualizations/` - Interactive HTML graphs and charts
- `dashboard/` - Metrics dashboard with drill-down capability
- `docs/` - Auto-generated technical documentation
- `database/` - SQLite database with all metrics

### Step 3: Functional Business Logic Documentation
**Prompt**: `3_functional_prompt.md`
**Input**:
- `Legacy_App/` (source of truth)
- All outputs from `documentation/parsed/`
**Output**: `documentation/functional/`

**Objectives**:
- Document WHAT the system does in business terms
- Map all business processes end-to-end
- Create comprehensive data dictionary
- Document all calculations and business rules
- Assess technical debt and migration readiness

**Key Deliverables**:
- `FUNCTIONAL_OVERVIEW.md` - Executive system summary
- `BUSINESS_FLOWS.md` - End-to-end process documentation
- `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` - Complete data catalog
- `CALCULATION_ENGINE.md` - All business calculations
- `MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md` - Modernization strategy
- `visualization/` - Business process diagrams

### Step 4: Subsystem Identification and Architecture
**Prompt**: `4_subsystems_prompt.md`
**Input**:
- `Legacy_App/` (for validation)
- All outputs from `documentation/parsed/`
- All outputs from `documentation/functional/`
**Output**: `documentation/subsystems/`

**Objectives**:
- Identify natural subsystem boundaries
- Document subsystem interactions and contracts
- Create migration-ready architecture documentation
- Define data ownership and governance
- Plan for independent subsystem evolution

**Key Deliverables**:
- `00_MASTER_SUBSYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Overall architecture
- Individual subsystem specifications in `Subsystems/`
- `Diagrams/` - Mermaid diagrams of all interactions
- `Analysis/` - Coupling, cohesion, and risk analysis
- Complete subsystem governance model

## EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:

### Sequential Execution
- Each step MUST complete successfully before the next begins
- Each step uses all previous outputs as additional context
- Validation checkpoints between each phase

### Quality Standards
- 100% coverage - every program must be analyzed
- Every business rule must be documented
- All dependencies must be mapped bidirectionally
- Documentation must be understandable by non-COBOL developers

### Analysis Depth
- Think ultra mega hard at each step
- Document everything exhaustively
- Capture both the obvious and the subtle
- Identify patterns, anti-patterns, and anomalies
- Consider both current state and future state

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:

1. **Completeness**
   - All 278 programs parsed and analyzed
   - All 175 copybooks mapped and documented
   - Every business process documented end-to-end
   - All subsystems identified with clear boundaries

2. **Accuracy**
   - Business logic preserved exactly
   - Dependencies correctly mapped
   - Calculations documented precisely
   - No functionality missed or misunderstood

3. **Usability**
   - Documentation readable by all stakeholders
   - Visualizations interactive and insightful
   - Clear migration path identified
   - Actionable recommendations provided

4. **Migration Readiness**
   - Subsystems ready for independent migration
   - Technical debt clearly identified
   - Risk assessment completed
   - Phased approach documented
