General Ledger - Changelog

ccyy-mm-dd  Who            What

05/06/23 Vincent Coen   * Tidy up print programs to use actual size in fdprint.cpy
                          for  gl030, 060, 072, 120.

13/11/21 Vincent Coen   * gl030 removed adding 1 to ws-menu if PC = space
                          No idea why used but it change user selection
                          It could how ever be a way to force gl030b to run
                          but it is not in the right place within the code so
                          further testing should see why if the  gl030b is not
                          being run instead of 03a if PC not used.

12/11/21 Vincent Coen   * gl030 Re-aligned menu as it had bad options from 3
                          under some conditions..

20/05/18 Vincent Coen   * gl030 updates for start of support as using to / from
                          accounts instead of using defaults via F9 but very
                          early days.
                          Increased default table size back to 33 but only as
                          temp values in posting program does NOT get written
                          out to file.
                          Also the layout of file is grouped for all fields to
                          suuport this as group 33 is used for this purpose.
                          GL030 still needs to be changed to support this.
                          This is to bring it inline to irs030 when complete.
                          Possible more coding changes from testing.
                          Yep, finally starting to test GL using core CoA from
                          irs as a model.
                          Found bugs for backup, wrong field being used for all
                          systems.
                          Stop doing a display on exit as causes a stop msg from
                          runtime.

29/04/18 Vincent Coen   * All FH call routines changed to clear Access-Type for
                          any other than Open so that the logger is cleaner.
                          ALL FH checked for EOF repeats so that status is
                          cleared if doing any function other than read next.
                          This applies to all ACAS systems.

10/02/18 Vincent Coen   * General along with the other ACAS systems is now ready
                          for system testing so the first is IRS as a set of
                          accounts is required to start but these CoA will be
                          used as a modal for GL without mPC or Branch
                          processing as that will come later.

                          Without these, IRS has a few more functions over
                          General as these two features (mPC and Branches) is
                          the primary reason for using GL over IRS.

                          At least it gives me a chance os converting the IRS
                          CoA (Chart of Accounts) to G/L if it is possible!
