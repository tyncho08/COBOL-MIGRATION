Introduction:
This document describes the types of file associated with the O/E System and their uses.
        1. 	COBOL source file. These include source code for all programs in the system and library of "copy" file which consist of COBOL source code which can be included in a program by the use of the COPY verb.
        2. COBOL object file. These are the machine executable programs which constitues the working O/E System.
        3. Data Files. These are the file which contain data entered into the O/E System.
Each class of file is discussed separately below.

Cobol Source Files: Program Source Files:
Program source file names have the following format:
OE(progname).CBL
where:
"OE"		is the system designator, all O/E System program names start with these two letters.
"progname" is up to eight characters which uniquely identify a specific program file.
NOTE: The Company File Maintenance and Valid G/L File Maintenance programs are not unique to the O/E System and thus do not carry the "OE" system designator.
Generally, program names are a concatenation of abbreviations for the words that constitute a functional description of what the module does. For example, The "O/E Item File Maintenance" program is named:
"OEITMMNT.CBL".
Version: GnuCobol	System: O/E	Release: 1

A source program may be broken up into one or more source modules to keep the individual source file size down to the point where It can be easily edited with Text editor. In this event, the first module is named as described above.
For example, "O/E Item File Maintenance" actually consists of two modules named:
"OE ITMMNT.CBL II  and "OE ITMMN2.CBL 11•
embedded in the source code of the first module, OEITMMNT/CBL, is the compiler directing statement: COPY "OEITMMN2/CBL". Thus compiling this program will result in the generation of a single object module named: "OEITMMNT/COB".

Cobol Source Copy Files:
In order to facilitate PROGRAM modification and PROGRAM maintenance, COBOL source statements that are common to many programs have been extracted into separate file which can be included in a COBOL program at compile time by the use of the "COPY" verb. Copy Files are named with a function
name of up to eight characters and a two character extension. For Example:
function/xx
where:
"function"= A descriptive name of what the code contained in the copy file either does or relates to.
"xx"	= The extension which identifies what DIVISION or SECTION of a COBOL program the copy file applies to.
The extensions used are:
SL= An Input/Output section SELECT statement.
FD= A Data Division File Section File description (FD) entry.
WS	A Data Division Working Storage Section entry.
OS= A Procedure Division Declarative Section entry.
PL= A Procedure Division entry, usually a frequently used subroutine.
Version: GnuCobol	System: O/E	Release: 1

Related Copy Files have the same function name with a different extension. For example, the Copy file that deal with the Valid G/L Account File are named as to follows:

ACCTFILE,SL ACCTFILE,FD ACCTFILE,WS
Contains the SELECT Statement for the file. Contains the File Description Entry.
Contains Working Storage entries needed to process the file.
ACCTFILE.DS Contains the Declarative Section entry which handles
1/0 error conditions encountered in processing the file.
all definitions, working storage entries and declaratives associated with all data file in the system are contained in copy file.
As another example, a commonly used subroutine which retrieves, reformats and saves the system date consists of procedure division logic and associated working storage entries. The Copy file that contain this code are named:
SYSDAT.WS Contains Working Storage entries needed to retrieve, reformat and store the System Date.
SYSDAT.PL Contains the procedure logic necessary to accomplish this.

Cobol Object Files:
Cobol object file are named as fol lows: progname/COB
Where:
"progname" is the program name of the source module from which this object file was compiled. Or, if the source program was broken up into multiple modules, the program name of the first module.
Version: GnuCobol	System: O/E	Release: 1

Data Files:
Data Files are named according to the following conventions:
OE(File name).DAT
Where:
"OE"	is the system designator.
"File name" is a six character name that is unique to that file.
NOTE: The Company File and the Valid G/L Account File are not unique to the O/E System and thus do not have the "OE" system designator.
File names are a concatenation of abbreviations of the words in the full English language name of the file. For example, the Inventory Item File is named:
OEITMFIL.DTA

CFOEFILS,CBL may be compiled and run to Initialize O/E Data Files. This program opens each file on Ifs specified device in output mode and then closes the file. Any data contained within a file will be destroyed.

Selection Code for the order is set as "incomplete".
Version: GnuCobol		System: O/E Module Name: ORDER PROCESSING
Release: 1
This program then calls OEITMADD to enter the individual line Items for the order.
After the Items have been added, if the order is a credit memo or invoice the program calls OEOEMISC to complete the billing information.
The Order Header record is rewritten after all entries have been made.
For credit Memos and Invoices the Selection Code is set as "selected"; for regular orders, If is set as "complete" and may be selected for billing in the Billing and Invoice Printing module.

OEITMADD
This program allows entry of the individual items for the order and updates the Quantity committed field in the Inventory Item File if Inventory Control is specified. See related screen layout and File Definitions.
Valid Item numbers are entered. If the Item number is a miscellaneous Item, entry of the description is required, otherwise, the description is displayed from the Inventory Item File.
If the Fl key is pressed for the Item number, the user is allowed to enter the Item description (or part thereof). The program searches and displays all Items matching that description using the Alternate Key in the Inventory Item File. If the right one is not found, another Item number is entered.
After the Quantity ordered field is entered, for regular orders and invoices, a check- is made to see If there is inventory control and whether the Item is back-orderable or not.
If there is no inventory control for the system (or none for the Item),
the Quantity ordered becomes the Quantity to ship. There is no updating of Inventory done in the Inventory File.

If there is inventory control and the Quantity available (Quantity on hand
- Quantity committed in the Inventory File) is less than the Quantity ordered, the Quantity available is displayed and the user is allowed to select one of the options.
For a nonback-orderable Item, the options are to cancel the Item, order what's in stock or override. After the selection has been made, if the Item was not cancelled, the inventory Item qty committed is updated by adding to If the amount to be shipped and rewriting the record.

Re I ease: ·1
For a back-orderable Item, the options are to cancel the Item, back order the balance, back order the tul I Quantity, or override the inventory.
After the selection has been made, If the Item was not cancelled, the inventory Item Quantity committed field is updated by adding to If the Quantity ordered and rewriting the inventory Item record.
The remaining fields for the Item are entered. If the order is a credit memo, entry of Quantity to be returned to inventory is allowed. If the Item is a miscellaneous Item, entry or the unit cost is allowed.
The unit price is calculated using the price code associated with the inventory Item. The O/E Codes File is read and the price is calculated taking into account any discount on the price as set up in the O/E Codes File
After the Item is entered, changes are allowed by way or the "ANY CHANGE" question. The user is allowed to re-enter, If he wishes, any field previously entered by the cursor being displayed at the end or the field and allowing the Restart Key to be pressed to enter a new amount.
The total cost for the Item is calculated and added on to the totals in the Order Header record. The commission amount is calculated, based on
the Commission Code for the Item, and added to the Order Commission amount.
The Items entered are displayed by scrolling down the screen in the order that they are entered. This is done by setting up a screen table and storing the data as If is entered into the table elements. The lines of the table are moved down, and the table is displayed.

OEOEMISC
This program is called from OEOEADD and OEOECNG after the Items have been added and/or changed for all credit memos and invoices. This module completes the Order Header information. See related screen layout and File Definition.
After the miscellaneous charges amount is entered, If the amount was not zero, the A/R Control File is checked to see If multiple accounts exist for miscellaneous charges. If they do, a valid account is entered,
The sales tax is calculated using the customer's tax percent and the order taxable amount. The tax is displayed and may be overridden by pressing the Restart key and entering a new amount.
PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS

Version: GnuCobol		System: O/E Module Name: ORDER PROCESSING
Release: ·1
The freight amount is entered. If the amount entered was not zero and multiple account exist for freight charges in the A/R Control File, a valid account is entered.
If the Commission Amount calculated and accumulated for all Items on the order is zero, the Commission Percent is entered and the commission amount is calculated and displayed.
If the accumulated commission amount is not zero, then the percent is not entered, and the commission amount is displayed.
Any subsequent entry of the commission percent will result in a recalculation of the commission amount based on the entered percent.
After the fields have been entered, the record is passed back to OEOEADD and the Order Header record is rewritten.

OEOECNG
This program allows changes to the main order information or any order that has not been invoiced (as long as the order is flagged as "complete" and has not been selected for billing). The order number is entered and the contents of the Order Header record are displayed.
Changes are made and the Order Header record is rewritten. The program then calls OE ITMCNG to make any changes to the individual new Items.
If the order is a credit memo or invoice, the Order Header record is passed to OEOEMISC for any changes in the billing information.
After all changes have been made, the Order Header record is rewritten.
OEITMCNG
This program allows changes to the line Items of an order and updates the inventory Quantity committed accordingly.
A valid Item number is entered. If the Item is not on the order a message is displayed and the Item may be added to the order If the user wishes.
If the F1 key is pressed, the program will bring up the next Item on file for the order.
Version: GnuCobol		System: O/E Module Name: ORDER PROCESSING
Release: 1

The fields are displayed and any needed changes are entered. If the user changes the Quantity Ordered, entry of the Quantity To Ship field is required. The Quantity available is displayed at the bottom of the screen. If the Quantity to ship entered is less than the Quantity ordered, then the remaining amount is designated as either out of stock or back ordered. The Inventory Item record is updated taking into account the Quantity to ship and Quantity back ordered (if any).
The END key pressed for the Item number will terminate this portion of Order Entry.

OEOEDEL
This program deletes selected orders and updates the Inventory File as needed.
A valid order number is entered. The order fields are displayed. If the user wishes to delete the order, he answers "Y" to the question "OKAY TO DELETE ORDER?". The Order Header record is deleted.
The corresponding Line Items for the order are then read. If there is Inventory Control in the system and the Item has inventory control, the Inventory record is updated. If the Item is back-orderable, the Line Item Quantity ordered is subtracted from the Inventory Quantity Committed. If the Item is nonback-orderable, the Line Item Quantity to ship is subtracted from the Inventory Quantity Committed. The Inventory record is then rewritten.
The Line Items for the order are deleted.

OEORDEDT
A screen is displayed to ask what the starting and ending range should be.

After the user enters the screen data, the order header information and corresponding line Items are printed per the report format. If "ALL" orders were selected, control returns to the Order Processing Menu, otherwise, the screen is re-displayed and a new starting and ending range is obtained. Control returns to the Order Processing Menu after "ALL" orders are selected or after the END key has been pressed.

The order selection screen is displayed and an order number entered. If the Fl key is pressed, the first, or next unselected order on file is found and displayed. If the end of the file is reached, an error message is displayed and the file starts over from the beginning.
If an order number is entered the record is read and displayed. If the order is not found or incomplete or is an invoice or credit memo an error message is displayed and a new order number accepted.
When a valid order has been found, changes are allowed to If. Then the Line Item billing menu is displayed. This menu allows three selections:
1 - BILL ALL Items
    2 - BILL SELECTED Items
    3 - BILL ALL Items EXCEPT X
If number 1 is selected: 1) all line Items on file for the order are read, their selection codes are set to "selected" (S), and the records are rewritten. 2) The total order amount, total taxable amount, and total cost are recalculated by reading through the line Items. 3) OEBLMISC is
called. 4) The order selection code is set to "selected" (S). 5) The Order Header Record is rewritten.
If number 2 is selected: 1) If the order is already selected all of the Ii new Items for the order are set to "unselected" (space). 2) OEBLLSEL is called. 3) The total order amount, total taxable amount, and total I cost are recalculated figuring in only those Items which have been selected in OEBLLSEL. 4) OEBLMISC is called. 5) The order selection code is set to "selected" (S). 6) The Order Header Record is rewritten.
If number 3 is selected: 1 ) A II line Items for the order are set to "selected" (S). 2) OEBLLSEL is called. 3) The total order amount, total taxable amount, and total cost are recalculated figuring in only those Items which are flagged as "selected" (S). 4) OEBLMISC is called. 5) The order selection code is set to "selected" (S). 6) The Order Header Record is rewritten.
The recalculation of order header fields as mentioned in 1, 2 and 3 above is done on the total taxable amount, total sale amount, total cost, tax amount and commission amount.

OEBLLSEL
This program allows selection of particular Items on an order. The line selection screen is displayed and an inventory Item number is entered.
If the Fl key is pressed, the first or next line Item on file for that order is found and displayed. If there are no more line Items for the order, an error message is displayed and the file starts over at the first line Item of the order.
If an inventory Item number is entered the first line Item for the order with that Item number is found and displayed (there may be more than one line Item with the same Item number). The question "RIGHT Item?" is displayed and if If is not the right Item, the next line Item for the order with the same Item number is found and displayed and so on until the right Item is found or there are no more Items on file for the order. If there are no more line Items on file for the order and the right Item has not been found, the message "LINE Item NOT ON FILE'' is displayed and a new inventory Item number is accepted.
Once the correct Item is found the question "BILL THIS Item ?11 is asked. If the answer is "no" the Item selection code is set to "unselected" (space) and the record is rewritten. If the answer is "yes" changes are allowed, the Item selection code is set to "selected" (S) and the record is rewritten.
If the Item is not backorderable and the Quantity to ship is changed, the Quantity committed field in the Inventory File is changed to reflect this.
If the unit price is changed a test is made to see which commission percent now applies. If the new price entered is the same as price 1, 2 or 3 of the Inventory Item File the commission percentage associated with
this price in the Commission Code File is used (this commission percent is moved to the commission percent field in the Line Item File). If none or these prices match the new price entered, the price override commission percent is used.
The above is repeated until the END key is pressed.

OEBLMISC
This program allows entry of the miscellaneous charges, freight amount, tax amount etc. (see related Data Entry Specifications) for the Order Header Record. The third order screen is displayed and fields entered. The END key is nor allowed and the Restart Key just clears the screen and allows re-entry of all of the fields. After all fields have been entered changes are allowed.
For the freight amount and the miscellaneous charges amount an account number is also entered If A) The amount is not zero and B) If the A/R Control File indicates that freight or miscellaneous charges amounts are distributed.
The sales tax is computed on the total taxable amount and the tax percent for the order.
The order total amount is calculated and displayed right after the freight amount is entered and is the total of the order net amount, the
miscellaneous charges, the tax amount and the freight amount. If any of these amounts are changed, the total order amount is recalculated and redisplayed.
If the total commission amount for the order is not zero, If is not manually entered but is displayed and can be changed through the Item number to change logic. If a commission percent is entered the commission is calculated based on this percentage and the total sale amount. This wipes out the previously calculated commission amount.

OEBLOUNS
This program allows un-selection of selected orders. The order un-selection screen is displayed and an order number is entered.
If the F1 key is pressed, the first, or next selected order on file is found and displayed. If the end of the file is reached, a message is displayed and the file starts over from the beginning.
If an order number is entered, the record is read and displayed. If the record is not on file or incomplete or if If is an invoice or credit memo, an error message is displayed and a new order number is entered.

The above is repeated until the END key is pressed.

OEORDEDT
See Order Processing Program Specifications.

OEMNTINV / OEINVOIC
This program prints invoices for all selected orders and credit memos. After printing the invoices if the printing is "OK", sales transaction records are created, and the Inventory and Order file are updated appropriately.
The invoice date and default comments are entered per the VDT layout. The order range to be printed is entered per the VDT layout.
The Order Header File is started at the starting order number. Before printing the invoice, the program checks to ensure the order has been selected. The line Items are read for that order. The invoice is printed using the Order Header Record and the selected line Items for that order.
After printing the invoice, the Order Header Record is rewritten, setting the Order Selection Code to Order Invoiced but not OK.
After the selected invoices have been printed, the question "ARE INVOICES JUST PRINTED OK ?" is asked. If they are not OK., the selected orders are rewritten setting the Order Selection Code to Order Selected. If  they are okay, the orders are rewritten with the selection code of Order Invoiced.
The order range screen is redisplayed and new range or orders is entered
and processing proceeds as above.
If the END key was pressed for the order range, OEPSTINV is called to post invoices.
PROGRAM	SPECIFICATIONS

Module Name: BILLING AND INVOICE PRINTING
Release: ·1

OEPSTINV
This program reads the Order Header File and Order Line Item File and writes A/R Sales Transaction File and A/R Sales Distribution Transaction File records for subsequent posting to A/R master file.
A sales transaction is written out for each invoice flagged as Order Invoiced.
If multiple distribution accounts exist for sales, freight, or miscellaneous charges, a sales distribution transaction record is written for each amount using the miscellaneous charges and freight accounts entered in order selection, and the sales account specified in the Inventory Item File for each line Item. The profit centre entered at order entry time is used as the last three digits of	the account number.
Each selected line Item record is read and the inventory Item file is updated. The Quantity to Ship is subtracted from the Quantity on hand.
If there is Inventory Control, the Quantity to Ship is subtracted from the Quantity Committed. The Period-to-date and Year-to-date fields are updated using the Quantity Shipped, Line Item Unit Price and Discount fields.
Each line Item is checked to see if there is a Quantity Back Ordered. If there is, the Quantity Back Ordered is moved to the Quantity Ordered, the Quantity to Ship is set to zero, the Item is unselected and the record is rewritten. Otherwise, the Line Item Record is deleted.
After the above is done for each order, the order is checked to see If If has any line Items remaining. If If does not, the Order Header Record is deleted. Otherwise, the order amounts are set to zero, the order is unselected and the Order Header Record is rewritten. If the order was an invoice order, If is changed to a regular order and the Order Header Record is rewritten for future selection or the remaining back-ordered Items.
After posting is complete the program returns to the billing menu.

OEPCDMNT
This program is the File Maintenance module for the Price Code File. The Price Code File is actually part of the O/E Codes File (see related File Definition).
Since there are many places in this program where very similar entries are made repeditively and since this data is stored for the most part in matrices, loops have been utilised wherever possible in place of the regular screen display, field display, field entry and change paragraphs.
The loops are logically structured per the Warnier Orr method of structuring. The first field is inspected, then a loop is entered. In the loop a field is processed then the next field is inspected. This is performed until all fields have been processed.
For screen displays there is a paragraph that displays one "tag" or one set of "tags". This paragraph is performed a certain number of times. E.g., if a screen consists of five "tags'' or five sets of two "tags", a paragraph that displays one tag or set would be performed five times.
For field displays there is a paragraph that displays one field or one set of two fields. This paragraph is displayed a certain number of times.
For pricing code types two and five there are matrices containing up to five customer types. These are displayed one at a time by a loop as above until a field containing only spaces is found. In other words the paragraph would be performed 1 to 5 times.
PROGRAM	SPECIFICATIONS

Version: GnuCobol	System: O/E
Module Name: PRICING CODE FILE MAINTENANCE
Release: 1

For field entry there is a paragraph that enters one field, Usually this is performed until as many fields as can be entered have been or the Restart Key is pressed. When a matrix of customer types is being entered, the paragraph is performed until a null entry (spaces) has been made or the matrix is full. If the Restart Key is pressed after the first type has been entered, the matrix of customer types is cleared and entry is started over.
For entry of changes a loop is not required except when changing a matrix of customer types. Normally the screen row and column are just calculated from the Item number to change and the field is re-entered, For a matrix of customer types, changes are allowed to one customer type at a time much as in the entry logic until the first null field (spaces) is reached or the Restart Key pressed. If along the way a customer type is cleared by the user, the rest of the fields in that matrix must be moved back to ????ti 11	the space.
In add mode, the key is not checked against the file until after the entire record has been entered. This is because what is put into the key depends on data entered later in the program. i.e., the price code customer type is part or the key, but is not entered until number 4 on the screen and then only If the price code type is 3,
Price code type 3 sometimes requires many records to define one price code. For any other type only one record per code is allowed. Therefore, a "Header Record" is stored in the file along with any group of price code type 3 records. This "Header Record" is just a dummy record with the price code in the key, but no customer type (spaces) in the customer type field. How this works is illustrated below.
EXAMPLE OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE "HEADER RECORD" WERE NOT USED.
As an example, suppose the following records are on file:

RECORD 1
I •  I  I I  I I I I  I I  I I  I I I I I  I I I
.KEY
.PRICE-CODE:AA
,CUST-TYPE:BBBBB

.RECORD

R.E.C.O.R.D...4.............

Price code "AA" is a "type 3"	code. Notice that price code "AA" is defined by 2 records ( records 1 and 2). Notice also that price codes "DD" and "EE" are defined by only one record and that an attempt to enter another type 1,2,4 or 5 record with the same price code would cause a duplicate key condition. This is OK., but what If someone were to enter the following record.

.KEY
,PRICE-CODE:AA
.CUST-TYPE:(spaces)
.RECORD
,TYPE:4
.( other fields)
This record has a unique key because If is nor a type 3 record and so has spaces for a customer type.
But this record should not be allowed on the file along with records 1 and 2.
Price code "AA" is supposed to be type 3.
The solution is that when record 1 is first entered a "Header Record" is written out that "reserves" that price code for type 3 records. For this example here is what the "Header Record" would look like.
H.E.A.D.E.R..R.E.C.O.R.D.........
.KEY
,PRICE-CODE:AA
.CUST-TYPE:(spaces) .
.RECORD

This record is not used to store any data relating to pricing. If is just used to reserve price code type "AA" for type 3 records.
If records 1 and 2 were both deleted, the "Header Record" would also be deleted.
