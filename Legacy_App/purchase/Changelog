dd/mm/yy  Who           What

2025-08-19 Vincent Coen * Update / bug fixes tpo pl020.

2025-01-05 Vincent Coen * Update pl130 to read param rec and rewrite after FLAG
                          update. Will need to do same for any prog that updates
                          ANY param fields. Use zz900/910 in S/P l130 code
                          for any programs that also update any paran fields.
                          Ditto for pl020.

10/03/24 Vincent Coen   * PL920 changes - support for reading system rec every time
                          a new folio is input to get next one and system rec
                          rewritten. On writing if dup key get another folio #
                          using same process.
                          This will reduce the possiblility of dup recs if more than
                          one person is inputting folios at same time.

23/08/23 Vincent Coen   * The process that posts posting records to GL from SL
                          and PL must be tested in detaails in GL.
                          as I suspect it will not work due to the way GL uses
                          batched postings. ONLY applies if GL in use.

27/07/23 Vincent Coen   * New programs added pl800 (recurring menu) plus change
                          to purchase menu and pl180 to cater for it.
                          The active progrms not yet written as awaiting tests
                          for the SL versions.

03/04/23 Vincent Coen   * Changed printer from 132 to 80 in sl070 & pl070.

16/12/22 Vincent Coen   * PL190 spelling error for lit - Supplier.

29/04/18 Vincent Coen   * All FH call routines changed to clear Access-Type for
                          any other than Open so that the logger is cleaner.
                          ALL FH checked for EOF repeats so that status is
                          cleared if doing any function other than read next.
                          This applies to all ACAS systems.
                          Found bugs for backup, wrong field being used for all
                          systems. Stop doing a display on exit as causes a stop
                          msg from runtime.

29/03/18 Vincent Coen   * Chgs to pl020, 030 by msgs # adjusted to match up
                          and added tests for folios on hold and paid.
                          Still need to do more including checks for what
                          happens with SC linked to verify recs are updated and
                          if so when.

22/03/18 Vincent Coen   * Autorun code now in runable via sales or purchase.
                          THIS is NOT recommended.

                          Update some of the MT (Audit, Anal and other unit
                          using Delete-All functions to match code updates.
                          Also All LD programs updated for calling-data as used
                          in the common call params now to support Autorun for
                          st020, st040 there might be more for special
                          processing such as end of month allowing run via stock
                          to print audit and run End of period processing
                          at 00:01 on 1st of month.
                          Need to so the same for other systems as needed as
                          well as XL150. No doubt more manual changes needed
                          but wait for system and End to End testing.

10/02/18 Vincent Coen   * Purchase along with the other ACAS systems is now
                          ready for system testing so the first is IRS as a
                          set of accounts is required to start.
                          I may well make use of irs testing to do some testing
                          of General but will only use it without any mPC/Branch
                          testing but this should cover a lot of ground.
                          The usage of Branches or mPC (multiple profit centres)
                          is an expansion of the facilities within IRS so should
                          map well - I hope.

26/08/17 Vincent Coen   * Work done on in Sales has been passed to PL as well
                          checking for any errors as seen in SL.

                          All comments made in the changelog for Sales generally
                          apply here as well.
