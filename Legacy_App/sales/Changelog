2025-01-05 Vincent Coen * Micro coding chg for sl910 to match pl020.

2025-03-07 Vincent Coen * Updates to sl970, sl910 BUT testing in progress.
                          These will allow support for Back Order Processing.
                          Still to do - sl800 series programs for autogen.

2025-01-05 Vincent Coen * Update sl130 to read param rec and rewrite after FLAG
                          update. Will need to do same for any prog that updates
                          ANY param fields. Use zz900/910 in S/P l130 code
                          for any programs that also update any paran fields.
                          Updated sl910 -missing rewrite.
                          Updated accept X with UPPER and remove function
                          Upper-Case although might have missed 1 or 2.

2024-12-12 Vincent Coen * SL910 Updates to fix functions if BO Qty = 0 by
                          confirming on "D" to delete BO record or S = Skip
                          this time etc.
                          Ready for testing... and yes I am expecting the odd
                          bug :(


2024-03-30 Vincent Coen * New program sl970 added and into sl900 menu.
                          More changes to st020 for BO record, Added new
                          field in Stock (Stock_Arrival-Date) fd, ws stock
                          updated. Ditto for Tables in ACASDB.sql.
                          No convert program created for stock as no one is
                          reporting that system is used for prod there again..
                          Nuts amending program acasconvert1 to update stock.

2024-09-15 Vincent Coen * SL910 updates -
                          All BO coding now complete BUT zz210-Delete... has a goto
                          to bypass code so that the BO file does not need to be
                          rebuilt after every BO test but last test must be without
                          the goto.

2024-09-11 Vincent Coen * SL910 updates -
                          BO (Back Order) processing coding complete other than
                          for deleted BO records now invoiced. That is next,
                          using a new small table to record the BO table entries
                          invoiced. This to be used to then delete the BO record
                          Support for using vat codes 4 & 5 for Sales tax - USA?

2024-04-13 Vincent Coen * 1. BO rec check in sl010 if trying to delete cust.
    and                   2. New menu function Amend Back Order Status option 6
2024-04-14                allows change to selected range, just one or all
                          customers changing BO status using Y or N.
                          3. Adding code to process BO in sl910 on first starting
                          All new code but taken from existing where ever poss.
                          All BO code removed from sl920 as pointless as sl970
                          can deal with amend and delete as well as reporting.
                          4. Updates to manuals :
                          ACAS - Building the ACAS System
                          ACAS - Stock Control
                          ACAS - Sales Ledger
                          covering BO additions and changes and some clean ups for
                          ACAS - System Set up Procedures

2024-03-17 Vincent Coen * BO support for sl910 more to do.
                          New program sl970 for BO reporting and amends/deletes
                          accessed via Sales menu T.A.
                          BO Only supported in Level-2 invoicing with linked
                          stock - where stock control in use.

2024-03-15 Vincent Coen * Support or new field Sales-Partial-Ship-Flag in sl010,
                          sl160.

2024-03-10 Vincent Coen * SL910 changes - support for reading system rec every time
                          a new invoice is input to get next one and system rec
                          rewritten. On writing if dup key get another invoice #
                          using same process.
                          This will reduce the possiblility of dup recs if more than
                          one person is inputting invoices at same time.

2024-02-08 Vincent Coen * For Sales record :-
                          Added Partial ship flag into the filler, no rec size
                          change. This to support Back Ordering etc, may be.

2023-08-23 Vincent Coen * The process that posts posting records to GL from SL
                          and PL must be tested in detaails in GL.
                          as I suspect it will not work due to the way GL uses
                          batched postings. ONLY applies if GL in use.

2023-06-27 Vincent Coen * sl930 Added email processing and including prtpdf
                          scripts.
                          THIS NEEDS TO BE TESTED AND THERE IS TEST CODE WITHIN
                          sl930 that after testing needs to be removed for
                          production.

2023-06-09 Vincent Coen * SL200, sl810 & possible others, bug fixes found during
                          testing - more to find ?

2023-05-20 Vincent Coen * New Autogen programs coding complete - sl800, 810, 820
                          830.  Dry testing next before functional testing and
                          YES I am expecting bugs :(
                          Must remember to call sl830 post autogen records,
                          BEFORE running the Invoice post processing via the
                          sales menu in case it was not run.
                          The sl830 posting program creates Invoice records so
                          that the normal invoice posting flow can continue
                          without any issues if not run daily and it will action
                          Autogen invoicing in a date window of munus 2, plus 2
                          days around the next date due to allow for weekends &
                          bank holidays etc.
                          It would be a problem if more than 4 days elapsed
                          without running such as a computer system shutdown due
                          to extended holiday or other break.

                          With these new programs a new file has been created
                          which is file04 named slautogen.dat and once testing
                          has completed I will also create the SLauogen rdbms
                          table to match although I might do this earlier while
                          I remeber to do so...

                          If you have been getting the night builds you should
                          delete sales sources sl845.* sl850.* as they are
                          redundant as were only used as place holders while
                          coding sl830.
                          In any event they will not compile without errors.

                          Note that although I have allowed for same programs
                          for Purchase Ledger this has not been coded as I am
                          not so sure they will be useful to anyone BUT if you
                          have a need for such let me know via email and I will
                          add them after testing the sales ledger versions.
                          There are very minor differences as far as I remember.
                          In the meanwhile I have allowed for the supporting
                          file and table entries but again not coded.

2023-05-20 Vincent Coen * sl050 added line items to reports to match sl820.
                          Have to see if it is now too much reporting though.
                          Need to check report layouts during testing.
                          it may well have been in use in older versions !
                          Updates to sl810, sl820 - more in progess.

2023-05-04 Vincent Coen * Some manual changes with Autogen included as well
                          as usage details by program.
                          Four new programs namely:
                          sl800 (Autogen menu), sl810 (Autogen Entry/amend)
                          sl820 (Autogen Proof) and sl830 (Autogen Post).
                          sl810 relies on Stock control being used in invoice
                          mode 2 (line items).
                          sl830 auto invoice numbering with Stock control and
                          Analysis and valuing in operation.
                          These are in creation mode so not usable at the moment
                          but the Autogen menu is available but should not be
                          used at this time to access any of the options.
                          CAUTION the above program numbers may change subject
                          for the need for additional coding / programs etc.

2023-04-08 Vincent Coen * Updates to SL manual, more printer size changes for
                          portrait size - stops blank lines on 7305 printer.

2023-04-03 Vincent Coen * Changed printer from 132 to 80 in sl070 & pl070.

2023-03-06 Vincent Coen * SL930 and 950 added VAT number at end of business
                          address if non spaces in system record. Better at the
                          top than near the bottom as could end up anywhere in
                          position. Clean file to end by cc80.

2023-02-18 Vincent Coen * Sl930 printer routine changed to accept "FILE:
                          in System print file names instead of cups spool names
                          so that files are saved as is.
                          IT IS UP TO USER TO PROCESS THEM MANUALLY.
                          Useful for testing mostly.
                          IMPORTANT = = = = = = = >>>>
                          Changes for bug in aa020-Open for acas016,29,22,26,29.
                          Used in S/L invoice, otm3, P/L Ledger, Invoice & otm5.
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                          acas-nightly.rar has been updated  00:01 GMT 19 Feb.

2020-06-16 Vincent Coen * All programs that use special stationery have had
                          Changes namely sl190, sl110, sl930 and sl950.
                          Most changes are very minor in nature but to support
                          use of plain paper requiring the printing of extra
                          heading lines.
                          There may be more to do - subject to testing.
                          This is still outstanding - 2023-02-19.

2018-04-29 Vincent Coen * All FH call routines changed to clear Access-Type for
                          any other than Open so that the logger is cleaner.
                          ALL FH checked for EOF repeats so that status is
                          cleared if doing any function other than read next.
                          This applies to all ACAS systems.
                          Found bugs for backup, wrong field being used for all
                          systems. Stop doing a display on exit as causes a
                          stop msg from runtime.
                          Date format change as of this update to Intl / Unix.

These are in dd/mm/yy order as I can't be bother to change them

22/03/18 Vincent Coen   * Autorun code now in runable via sales or purchase.
                          THIS is NOT recommended.

21/03/18 Vincent Coen   * Updated sl940 for the missing Audit, stock file update
                          before deleting an invoice. Updated Buiding and SL
                          manuals with new messages.
                          Update some of the MT (Audit, Anal and other unit
                          using Delete-All functions to match code updates.
                          Also All LD programs updated for calling-data as used
                          in the common call params now to support Autorun for
                          st020, st040 there might be more for special
                          processing such as end of month allowing run via stock
                          to print audit and run End of period processing at
                          00:01 on 1st of month.
                          Need to so the same for other systems as needed as
                          well as XL150. No doubt more manual changes needed
                          but wait for system and End to End testing.

10/02/18 Vincent Coen   * Sales along with the other ACAS systems is now ready
                          for system testing so the first is IRS as a set of
                          accounts is required to start.
                          I may well make use of irs testing to do some testing
                          of General but will only use it without any mPC/Branch
                          testing but this should cover a lot of ground.
                          The usage of Branches or mPC (multiple profit centres)
                          is an expansion of the facilities within IRS so should
                          map well - I hope.

26/08/17 Vincent Coen   * Revisit code checking all for itm3 and invoice for
                          any errors prior to revisit and finish off Purchase
                          as found problems within that may be also in Sales.
                          Some problem found but mostly silly ones - so far.
                          Done - sales, sl000 - sl920.
                                 sl930, sl940, sl950, sl960.

                          Testing to be started after full data backup of
                          v3.01.07 and creating new source dir - ACAS-3.02.01
                          AND new data dir for init testing using Cobol files
                          only. Why? because there are RDB loader programs for
                          all files but NOT the other way around.
                          After Cobol file testing, test loader programs and
                          re-test using RDB, create new rdb database for loading
                          all data from the start into RDB verifying all
                          operations.

                          At the same time of system testing update / rewrite
                          all ACAS manuals and create a new manual for full
                          systems set up may well create new program ACAS-setup
                          to create files/tables and data that is required for
                          use such as :
                          System Parameter Files
                          Analysis
                          IRS Chart of Accounts using default set (company).
                          Stock with base data.
                          Sales and invoicing with base data.
                          Purchase with base data.

                          Look at creating automated testing scripts if I can
                          find a free CHOTS tool for Linux as existing is
                          commercial product and is some what old in the tooth.

09/02/17 Vincent Coen   * Updated all ACAS systems to 3.02 to use RDB or Cobol
                          files.
                          Changed sl190 to use sorted Open item file or RDB.
                          to provide sorted history per customer.
                          This bug has been there for ages - why has no one
                          reported it?

18/05/13 Vincent Coen	  * Remapped all invoice & open item files to support
                          link to SC (Stock Control) when using Invoicing so
