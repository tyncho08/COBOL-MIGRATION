                          For source and target files now using .seq for src
                          and .dat for target, added test for on output file
                          to confirm no non zero return codes.
                          Have not done the same for *UNL as the reporting
                          messages will indicate that as zero output.
                          These program have Not had a version change.

                          first.

2025-01-05 Vincent Coen * Update sl130 to read param rec and rewrite after FLAG
                          update. Will need to do same for any prog that updates
                          ANY param fields. Sames for SL130. Use zz900/910 code
                          for any programs that also update any paran fields.
                          Match up date format as used with systems Changelogs,
                          i.e., yyyy-mm-dd and not dd-mm-yyyy.

2024-03-15 Vincent Coen * For sys002 added support for fields
                          SL-BO-Flag & Stk-BO-Active in system file.

                          create/amend.

2023-07-27 Vincent Coen * All four affected DAL modules have been fixed.
                          Currently waiting on testing using the *LD programs
                          after creating some new invoices.
                          New programs added pl800 (recurring menu) plus change
                          to purchase menu and pl180 to cater for it.
                          The active progrms not yet written as awaiting tests
                          for the SL versions.

2023-07-12 Vincent Coen * For all LD prgrams updated to fix various bugs & other
                          code cleanups.
                          For *invoiceMT.scb and *autogenMT fix bug using wrong
                          key in routines bc050-Process-Read-Index &
                          bc300-Update-rg1.

2023-07-02 Vincent Coen * For all *LD programs changed them to read acas.param
                          file if exists when system param rec does not hold
                          rdbms data. This so the system param does not need to
                          be changed just to load up tables.
                          The acas.param file uses the same details as the other
                          param files Other than the name in DBNAME as ACASDB.

2023-06-16 Vincent Coen * Changes for acas004, 030, sl810-830, *LD to process
                          file acas.param if system.dat not set for DB params
                          useful during testing when real tests are for Cobol
                          files. So need to create a call'd module to process to
                          be COPY'd in for all programs needing it.
