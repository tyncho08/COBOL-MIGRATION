                          For source and target files now using .seq for src
                          and .dat for target, added test for on output file
                          to confirm no non zero return codes.
                          Have not done the same for *UNL as the reporting
                          messages will indicate that as zero output.
                          These program have Not had a version change.

                          in progress.

                          first.

2024-09-15 Vincent Coen * SL910 updates -
                          All BO coding now complete BUT zz210-Delete... has a goto
                          to bypass code so that the BO file does not need to be
                          rebuilt after every BO test but last test must be without
                          the goto.

2024-09-11 Vincent Coen * SL910 updates -
                          BO (Back Order) processing coding complete other than

                          using a new small table to record the BO table entries
                          invoiced. This to be used to then delete the BO record
                          Support for using vat codes 4 & 5 for Sales tax - USA?

                          All BO code removed from sl920 as pointless as sl970
                          can deal with amend and delete as well as reporting.
                          4. Updates to manuals :

                          covering BO additions and changes and some clean ups for
                          ACAS - System Set up Procedures

2024-03-17 Vincent Coen * BO support for sl910 and sl920, more to do.

2024-03-15 Vincent Coen <vbcoen@gmail.com>
                        *  Support for BO-Flags in system, Stock, SL recs.
                           likewise in entry, amend and reporting. Stock is
                           limited in reporting.

2024-03-10 Vincent Coen <vbcoen@gmail.com>
                        * Sales and Purchase - invoice / folio data entry has
                          extra code to check for dup keys when writing out
                          invoices/folio recs & if happens will get system rec
                          to get next invoice / folio number and rewrite the
                          system rec. Ditto apples when first using a invoice /
                          folio #.
                          This will reduce risk of dup keys being used just in
                          case more than one user is entering invoices or folios
                          at same time. These is a risk of file or record locks
                          depending on ISAM library being used and the same
                          applies to a data base as well and that depends on the
                          setting for it when set up to ensure multi users can
                          have the same table opened at same time and this will
                          reduce/remove such possible problems.
                          Mysql and mariadb & others can be controlled this way.

2024-02-08 Vincent Coen <vbcoen@gmail.com>
                        * Sales Ledger file has had a new field for Partial Ship
                          Flag to indicate customer will accept a incomplete
                          order, where the intention is to send later any and
                          all outstanding stock items once received.

                        * Stock Control file has had new fields, Stat Date (not
                          yet used) and Stock-Committed to show qty ordered on
                          invoices, receipts etc prior to invoice and pack lists
                          printed. Here committed + Qty On hand = total stock
                          held at this point of time. No coding has yet been
                          done for this. This field is the same as
                          stock-Pre-Sales (redefined) also limited coding for
                          this to help not accept an order for zero stock items.
                          More work is needed may be in these areas at some
                          point, subject to testing.

                          This all relates to some extent to BO (Back Order)
                          processing but no user / business has requested it at
                          this point.  The requirements for processing of back
                          orders varies between business types and in most cases
                          is undertaken by the Sales teams manually to reduce
                          the differences between requirements and by orders.

                          In a Nutshell :-

                          There are two different types of function for BO
                          namely 1. Pre Orders against a product that has not
                          arrived in stock because of quantities ordered are
                          needed to estimate a stock order where delivery time
                          is known and not a long period OR 2. Is in transit
                          with a known short arrival date, OR 3 where product
                          is out of stock and time of arrival is or is not known
                          as an absolute date period etc.

                          In the later case if to be invoiced for a credit
                          customer the possible extra P&P costs are just added
                          to a new invoice OR where order is prepaid the company
                          will cover the P&P costs reducing profit margin or a
                          email or letter is sent out for the extra monies
                          required which in turn might annoy a customer and the
                          order is cancelled.

                          So the question comes into being of what a computer
                          should do for this set of differing requirements.

                          Basically not so easy, hence the reason it has been
                          left to be dealt with manually so far.

                          Suggestions on how it can be done for most if not all
                          ACAS users please get in touch.
