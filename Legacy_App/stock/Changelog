Stock Control - Changelog

2025-03-07 Vincent Coen * Updates to st020, st030 BUT testing in progress.
                          These will allow support for Back Order Processing.

2024-01-05 Vincent Coen * Fixed st020 to read, rewrite param file 4 field updating.

2024-12-13 Vincent Coen * For Sl010, 020 & 030 changed Page-Lines from 45 to 56
                          as wasting paper.

2024-12-13 Vincent Coen * stockconvert2 added note regarding compiling it.
                          code changes - adding close any opened files if
                          error condition does a STOP RUN - stops warning
                          messages.

2024-03-30 Vincent Coen * st020 updated to support NEW field stock-Arrived-Date
                          Includes changes to fdstock.cob and wsstock.cob.
                          Must remember to add it to Table record - DONE
                          AND stockMT - DONE.

                          Created program - stockconvert2.cbl to be used to
                          convert file stockctl to initialise the new field
                          stock-arrival-date as a safeguard.
                          Users should run it aftert making a back up of ALL
                          data files. Three is no provision for tables but the
                          file ACAS.sql has been updated to include it.
                          This MUST be created doing :
                          cobc -x stockconvert2.cbl

                          Note that the acas build scripts will create a .so for
                          this program, that will never be called and can be
                          ignored or deleted.

                          Note that st030 has NOT been updated to report on
                          it owing to not enough space on a report line to
                          contain it.
                          This field is updated when ever new stock arrives via
                          st020 Additions and it is used with Back orders
                          reporting in sl970.

2024-03-15 Vincent Coen * st010 updated to support BO -Flag.

2024-02-07 Vincent Coen * For st010 use individual move zeros intead of initialise
                          as it has used spaces for stock-TD fields with GC v3.2.
                          MUST REMEMBER TO CHECK THIS FOR THE OTHER files & records.

2024-02-07 Vincent Coen * Redefined stock-pre-sales with stock-committed.
                          Different names but same purpose.
                          Deleted st030.cbl-SORT-2 as this code is in st030.cbl.

2024-01-24 Vincent Coen * Found program st030.cbl-SORT-2 and this sorts stock
                          file in  description alpha order. as the START verb
                          may well not do so - subject to testing.
                          This code was written in August 2023.
                             No I do not remember it :(

2023-05-05 Vincent Coen * Confirmed that recs with Stock-Services-Flag set
                          do not have processing for adds or deducts but are
                          reported on.

2023-02-24 Vincent Coen * Update to Stock Control User Manual. mostly minor.

2023-02-06 Vincent Coen * st010 added initialise stock-record in places in
                          addition to performing zz070-  JIC as new stock rec
                          looks not set.

2018-04-29 Vincent Coen * All FH call routines changed to clear Access-Type for
                          any other than Open so that the logger is cleaner.
                          ALL FH checked for EOF repeats so that status is
                          cleared if doing any function other than read next.
                          This applies to all ACAS systems.
                          Found bugs for backup, wrong field being used for all
                          systems.
                          Stop doing a display on exit as causes a stop msg
                          from runtime.

20/04/18 Vincent Coen   * Updated st010 to support swapout of screen data when
                          F1 is pressed.
                          If works ok, will do the same for SL invoicing when
                          seaching for stock ref info.

21/03/18 Vincent Coen   * Updated sl940 for the missing Audit, stock file
                          update before deleting an invoice. Updated Building
                          and SL manuals with new messages.
                          Update some of the MT (Audit, Anal  other unit using
                          Delete-All functions to match code updates.
                          Also All LD programs updated for calling-data as used
                          in the common call params now to support Autorun for
                          st020, st040 there might be more for special
                          processing such as end of month allowing run via stock
                          to print audit and run End of period processing at
                          00:01 on 1st of month.
                          Need to so the same for other systems as needed as
                          well as XL150. No doubt more manual changes needed
                          but wait for system and End to End testing.

13/03/18 Vincent Coen   * All programs but excluding st050 now uses the standard
                          ACAS FH calling procedures instead of using FH routine
                          names ie., acas011-Open now uses Stock-Open.
                          [Should consider making st050 also use FH ] !
                          This way all ACAS programs use the same processes.
                          All effected programs have had their build number
                          incremented.
                          Also all ACAS menu programs are now coded more in line
                          with each other. Yes, all system will need re-testing.
                          Stock manual currently being updated again to conform
                          as well as new manual called ACAS - Building the ACAS
                          System  which cover the install and build of GnuCOBOL
                          Cobol compiler and all required packages as well as
                          the build and install of ACAS. Included is a full list
                          of All Warning and Error messages produced by ACAS
                          split down by program and system.
                          This will reduce the number of manuals that had the
                          same information and subsequently the number of areas
                          that could require updates of the same material.

                          TO BE TESTED:----- Is anal and audit updated from new
                          invoices.
                          Likewise is totals deducted from Stock recs
                          Likewise has current and monthly totals been updated
                          as I cannot see where, CAN NOW along with new code.

10/02/18 Vincent Coen   * Stock along with the other ACAS systems is now ready
                          for system testing but the first is IRS as a set of
                          accounts is required to start.
                          I may well make use of irs testing to do some testing
                          of General but will only use it without any mPC/Branch
                          testing but this should cover a lot of ground.
                          The usage of Branches or mPC (multiple profit centres)
                          is an expansion of the facilities within IRS so should
                          map well - I hope.

                          I will have to go to the local supermarket to grab
                          details of different produce in cans as my basic
                          stock products.

                          Or maybe use their on-line systems to get some details.
                          Yes, wishful thought!
