04/07/09 vbc - 1. Change proc's for Batch number so that same batch no is used
                  for same audit file and for both adds and deds. On audit
                  re-create, add 1 to stl-audit-no.

               2. add code for Sales and Purch for abrev stock no. in Purchase
                  Orders, Sales Invoices etc.

               3. Check if code exists for Purchase Orders and for convert to
                  received invoices and qty, abrev nos etc.

               4. ANYTHING I FORGOT??

               5. Stock:
                  add in Date ordered & Due to additions (010) by making space
                  by moving desc display to line 22 and remove line 22
                  (ws-22-lines) from data capture screens.
                  Do we have enought space on a line for this?
                [5] THIS LOOKS DONE - NEED TO RECHECK.
