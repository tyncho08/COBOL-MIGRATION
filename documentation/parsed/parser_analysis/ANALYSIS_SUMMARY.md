# COBOL Analysis Suite - Summary Report
Generated: 2025-09-17T19:53:05.810Z

## Overview
This report summarizes the comprehensive analysis performed on the COBOL codebase.

## Key Findings

### System Statistics
- Review the metrics dashboard at `dashboard/index.html` for interactive visualizations
- See `docs/system-documentation.md` for detailed system architecture

### Visualizations Available
1. **Call Graph** (`visualizations/call-graph.html`)
   - Interactive network diagram showing program dependencies
   - Color-coded by program type
   - Click nodes for detailed information

2. **Procedure Flow** (`visualizations/procedure-flow.html`)
   - Individual program flow diagrams
   - Shows internal structure and control flow
   - Useful for understanding program logic

3. **Copybook Usage** (`visualizations/copybook-usage.html`)
   - Visual representation of copybook dependencies
   - Identifies most-used and unused copybooks
   - Helps in consolidation efforts

### Documentation Generated
- **System Documentation**: High-level architecture overview
- **Subsystem Documentation**: Detailed breakdown by functional area
- **Program Index**: Searchable reference of all programs
- **Copybook Index**: Complete copybook inventory
- **Dependency Analysis**: Detailed dependency relationships

### Metrics Highlights
- Programs analyzed: See dashboard for counts
- Complexity distribution available in dashboard
- Maintainability scores calculated for all programs
- Dead code and duplication analysis completed

### Database
A SQLite database schema has been generated with:
- Complete program inventory
- Dependency relationships
- Metrics data
- Pre-written analysis queries

To create the database:
```bash
cd parser_analysis/database
./create-database.sh
```

## Next Steps
1. Review high-complexity programs in the dashboard
2. Examine circular dependencies in the dependency analysis
3. Plan refactoring based on maintainability scores
4. Use the database for custom queries and analysis

## Migration Recommendations
See `docs/system-documentation.md` for detailed migration recommendations based on the analysis.
