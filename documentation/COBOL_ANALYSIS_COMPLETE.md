## Migration Roadmap Summary

### Recommended Migration Sequence

**Phase 1 - Foundation (Months 1-6)**
- REPORTING subsystem (low risk, high value)
- MASTER_DATA (centralize reference data)
- COMMON_SERVICES (modernize utilities)

**Phase 2 - Isolation (Months 7-12)**
- IRS_PROC (self-contained tax logic)
- BATCH_PROC (framework modernization)

**Phase 3 - Integration (Months 13-24)**
- INV_CTRL (with careful AR/AP coordination)
- Begin AR_MGMT analysis

**Phase 4 - Core Business (Months 25-36)**
- AR_MGMT (revenue cycle)
- AP_MGMT (procurement cycle)

**Phase 5 - Financial Core (Months 37-48)**
- GL_CORE (with full system coordination)

### Technology Recommendations
- **Architecture**: Microservices with API Gateway
- **Languages**: Java/Spring Boot, Python for analytics, Go for performance-critical
- **Data**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB for documents, Redis for caching
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker, Service Mesh
- **Integration**: REST APIs, Apache Kafka for events

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### Strengths to Preserve
1. Clear business domain separation
2. Comprehensive audit trails
3. Mature business logic
4. Complete functional coverage

### Critical Improvements Needed
1. **Decouple subsystems** - Current file-based integration is brittle
2. **Modernize UI** - Character-based interface limits usability
3. **Enable real-time** - Batch processing creates delays
4. **Improve maintainability** - High complexity impedes changes
5. **Add APIs** - No current integration capabilities

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Parallel run periods** for each subsystem migration
2. **Comprehensive testing** at each phase
3. **Strong governance** to prevent scope creep
4. **Preserve business logic** while modernizing technology
5. **Incremental approach** to manage risk

## Conclusion

The COBOL analysis pipeline has successfully:
- ✓ Parsed and analyzed 453 COBOL programs
- ✓ Created comprehensive technical documentation
- ✓ Mapped business functionality
- ✓ Identified 9 subsystems with clear boundaries
- ✓ Provided actionable migration roadmap

The ACAS system is well-structured for modernization, with clear subsystem boundaries that support a phased migration approach. While the technical debt is significant, the business logic is mature and comprehensive. With careful planning and execution, the system can be successfully transformed into a modern, maintainable architecture while preserving critical business value.

**Total Estimated Migration Timeline**: 48 months  
**Recommended Approach**: Phased subsystem migration with parallel run  
**Success Probability**: High with proper governance and resources
