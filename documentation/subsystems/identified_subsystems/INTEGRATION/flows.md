## Error Handling and Recovery

### Error Classification and Response

#### Network Errors
```
Connection timeout → Retry with exponential backoff
DNS resolution failure → Check configuration, alert admin
SSL certificate error → Validate certificates, renew if needed
Authentication failure → Check credentials, alert security
```

#### Data Errors
```
Format validation failure → Log error, send to manual review queue
Business rule violation → Return error to sender with details
Duplicate message → Ignore, log duplicate detection
Missing required fields → Reject with specific field errors
```

#### System Errors
```
Database connection lost → Retry operation, failover if needed
Disk space full → Alert operations, archive old files
Memory exhaustion → Restart service, investigate memory leak
Application crash → Restart service, escalate to development
```

### Recovery Procedures

#### Automatic Recovery
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Error Detected] --> B{Error Type?}
    B -->|Transient| C[Increment Retry Counter]
    B -->|Permanent| D[Route to Manual Queue]
    
    C --> E{Retry Limit Reached?}
    E -->|No| F[Wait Backoff Period]
    E -->|Yes| G[Mark as Failed]
    
    F --> H[Retry Operation]
    H --> I{Success?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Mark Complete]
    I -->|No| C
    
    G --> K[Alert Operations]
    D --> L[Create Work Item]
    J --> End([Recovery Complete])
    K --> End
    L --> End
```

#### Manual Recovery Process
```
1. Identify failed message/transaction
2. Analyze error logs and system state
3. Determine root cause
4. Apply corrective action:
   - Fix data format issues
   - Resolve business rule conflicts
   - Repair system configuration
   - Contact external partner
5. Resubmit transaction
6. Monitor for successful completion
7. Update procedures to prevent recurrence
