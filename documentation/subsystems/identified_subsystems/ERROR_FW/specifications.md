# Subsystem: ERROR_FW - Error Handling Framework

## Executive Summary

**Purpose**: The ERROR_FW subsystem provides centralized error handling, logging, and recovery services for the entire ACAS system, including error classification, automatic recovery procedures, alert generation, and comprehensive audit trails for troubleshooting and compliance.

**Business Value**: Ensures consistent error handling across all modules, provides automated recovery capabilities, enables rapid problem diagnosis, reduces system downtime, and maintains comprehensive audit trails for compliance and debugging.

**Key Users**:
- All ACAS subsystems (via error handling APIs)
- System administrators (error monitoring and resolution)
- Support team (troubleshooting and root cause analysis)
- Auditors (error audit trails and compliance)

**Criticality**: HIGH - Critical infrastructure service for system reliability

## Functional Capabilities

### Core Functions

1. **Error Classification and Logging**
   - Description: Standardize error categorization and create comprehensive error logs
   - Business Rules: Error severity levels, classification schemes, retention policies
   - Triggers: System errors, business rule violations, data validation failures
   - Outcomes: Classified and logged errors with full context information

2. **Automatic Error Recovery**
   - Description: Implement automated recovery procedures for common error conditions
   - Business Rules: Recovery strategies by error type, retry policies, escalation thresholds
   - Triggers: Recoverable errors, timeout conditions, resource conflicts
   - Outcomes: Automatic system recovery with minimal user impact

3. **Alert and Notification Management**
   - Description: Generate and distribute alerts based on error conditions and patterns
   - Business Rules: Alert thresholds, recipient rules, escalation procedures
   - Triggers: Critical errors, error rate thresholds, system failures
   - Outcomes: Timely notifications to appropriate personnel

4. **Error Analysis and Reporting**
   - Description: Analyze error patterns and generate management reports
   - Business Rules: Trend analysis, root cause identification, performance impact
   - Triggers: Scheduled analysis, error threshold breaches, management requests
   - Outcomes: Error analysis reports and improvement recommendations

### Business Processes Supported

- **System Reliability**: Automated error recovery and system stability
- **Problem Resolution**: Rapid error diagnosis and resolution
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Error audit trails and regulatory compliance
- **Performance Management**: Error impact analysis and optimization
- **Change Management**: Error pattern analysis for system improvements

## Interface Contracts

### Internal APIs/Services

- **LogError**: [ErrorCode, Severity, Context, UserID] → [LogID, Status]
- **HandleError**: [ErrorCondition, RecoveryOptions] → [RecoveryAction, Status]
- **GenerateAlert**: [AlertType, Severity, Recipients] → [AlertID, DeliveryStatus]
- **RecoverOperation**: [OperationID, RecoveryStrategy] → [RecoveryResult]

## Known Limitations
- **Real-time Analysis**: Limited real-time error pattern analysis capabilities
- **Predictive Capabilities**: Basic predictive error detection
- **Integration Complexity**: Manual configuration required for new error types
