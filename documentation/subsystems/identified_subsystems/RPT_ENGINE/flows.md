## Business Rules in Flows

### Report Generation Rules

1. **Data Security**
   - Users can only access data they're authorized to view
   - Sensitive data automatically masked based on user role
   - Cross-company data requires special authorization
   - Financial data restricted during closing periods

2. **Performance Management**
   - Large reports automatically queued for off-peak processing
   - Resource-intensive reports limited during business hours
   - Concurrent report limit enforced per user
   - System capacity monitoring with automatic throttling

3. **Quality Control**
   - All financial reports must balance to source systems
   - Control totals validated before distribution
   - Missing data flagged with clear indicators
   - Variance thresholds trigger automatic validation

### Distribution Rules

1. **Security Requirements**
   - Confidential reports require encrypted distribution
   - External recipients limited to approved email domains
   - File downloads logged with user identification
   - Print jobs tracked for audit compliance

2. **Timing Constraints**
   - Critical reports have priority in distribution queue
   - Regulatory reports meet filing deadlines
   - Board reports distributed 24 hours before meetings
   - Management reports available by 9 AM following period

3. **Retention Policies**
   - Financial reports retained for 7 years
   - Operational reports archived after 2 years
   - Personal copies automatically deleted after 90 days
   - Audit trail maintained for all access

   - User permissions cached per session

2. **Output Caching**
   - Identical reports reused within time window
   - Parameterized reports cached by parameter set
   - Formatted output stored for quick retrieval
   - Distribution lists cached for efficiency

### Resource Management

1. **Memory Optimization**
   - Streaming processing for large datasets
   - Garbage collection tuning
   - Memory pool management
   - Resource cleanup procedures

2. **Processing Optimization**
   - Parallel processing for independent sections
   - Database query optimization
   - Efficient sorting and filtering
