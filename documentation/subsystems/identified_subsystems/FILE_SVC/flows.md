    Start([File Access Request]) --> A[Validate User Credentials]
    A --> B{User Authorized?}
    B -->|No| C[Log Access Denial]
    B -->|Yes| D[Check File Permissions]
    
    D --> E{File Access Allowed?}
    E -->|No| F[Return Permission Error]
    E -->|Yes| G[Apply File Lock]
    
    G --> H{Lock Successful?}
    H -->|No| I[Return Lock Error]
    H -->|Yes| J[Open File]
    
    J --> K{File Opened Successfully?}
    K -->|No| L[Return File Error]
    K -->|Yes| M[Return File Handle]
    
    M --> N[Log Successful Access]
    N --> End([Access Granted])
    
    C --> End
    F --> End
    I --> End
    L --> End
```

### 2. Backup and Recovery Flow

    Scheduler->>FileService: Initiate Backup
    FileService->>FileService: Identify Files to Backup
    FileService->>FileService: Check File Status
    
    loop For Each File
        FileService->>FileService: Create File Copy
        FileService->>Storage: Write to Backup Location
        Storage-->>FileService: Confirm Write
        FileService->>FileService: Verify Backup Integrity
    end
    
    FileService->>Monitor: Report Backup Status
    FileService->>Scheduler: Backup Complete
    
    alt Backup Failed
        FileService->>Monitor: Send Alert
        FileService->>Scheduler: Retry Request
    end
```
