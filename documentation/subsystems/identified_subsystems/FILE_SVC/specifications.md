   - Outcomes: Reliable file operations with integrity checking

2. **File Security and Access Control**
   - Description: Implement file-level security and access authorization
   - Business Rules: User permissions, role-based access, encryption requirements
   - Triggers: File access requests, security policy changes
   - Outcomes: Secure file access with comprehensive audit trails

3. **File Backup and Recovery**
   - Description: Automated backup procedures and file recovery capabilities
   - Business Rules: Backup schedules, retention policies, recovery procedures
   - Triggers: Scheduled backups, disaster recovery needs
   - Outcomes: Protected data with reliable recovery options

4. **File Archival and Retention**
   - Description: Automated archival of older files based on retention policies
   - Business Rules: Retention periods, archival criteria, disposal procedures
   - Triggers: File age, storage capacity, compliance requirements
   - Outcomes: Optimized storage with compliance adherence

5. **File Integrity and Validation**
   - Description: Continuous monitoring and validation of file integrity
   - Business Rules: Checksum validation, corruption detection, repair procedures
   - Triggers: File access, scheduled integrity checks

- **Compliance Management**: Data retention and disposal compliance
- **Security Management**: File access control and audit trails
- **System Maintenance**: File system optimization and monitoring

## Interface Contracts

### Internal APIs/Services

- **FileOpen**: [FileName, AccessMode, UserID] → [FileHandle, Status]
- **FileRead**: [FileHandle, RecordNumber] → [RecordData, Status]
- **FileWrite**: [FileHandle, RecordData] → [RecordNumber, Status]
- **FileClose**: [FileHandle] → [Status]
- **FileBackup**: [FilePattern, BackupLocation] → [BackupID, Status]
- **FileRestore**: [BackupID, RestoreLocation] → [Status]

## Known Limitations
- **Concurrent Access**: Limited sophisticated file locking mechanisms
- **Version Control**: Basic file versioning capabilities only
- **Distributed Storage**: Single-server file system architecture
