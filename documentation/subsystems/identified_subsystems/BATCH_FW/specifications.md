# Subsystem: BATCH_FW - Batch Processing Framework

## Executive Summary

**Purpose**: The BATCH_FW subsystem provides the infrastructure and orchestration for all batch processing activities in ACAS, including scheduled jobs, month-end processes, year-end procedures, and high-volume transaction processing that cannot be performed in real-time.

**Business Value**: Ensures data integrity through controlled batch processing, enables processing of high-volume transactions during off-peak hours, maintains system performance during business hours, and provides reliable automation of recurring business processes.

**Key Users**:
- System administrators (job scheduling and monitoring)
- Finance team (period-end processing)
- Operations team (daily batch runs)
- IT support (error resolution and restart)

**Criticality**: HIGH - Essential for daily operations and period closures

- **RULE_BF_003**: Critical jobs must complete before business day start
- **RULE_BF_004**: Resource-intensive jobs cannot run concurrently

### Calculation Rules
- **CALC_BF_001**: Estimated completion = Average runtime × (Records to process / Average records)
- **CALC_BF_002**: Resource allocation = Base allocation × Priority factor × Load factor
- **CALC_BF_003**: Retry delay = Base delay × (2 ^ retry count) up to maximum

### Workflow Rules
