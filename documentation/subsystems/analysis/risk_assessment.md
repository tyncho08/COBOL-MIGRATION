# ACAS Subsystem Risk Assessment

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive risk assessment for the modernization of each ACAS subsystem. It identifies technical, business, operational, and compliance risks, along with mitigation strategies and contingency plans.

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Categories

1. **Technical Risks**: Code complexity, dependencies, data integrity
2. **Business Risks**: Revenue impact, operational disruption, user adoption
3. **Integration Risks**: Interface failures, data synchronization, timing issues
4. **Compliance Risks**: Regulatory requirements, audit trail, data privacy
5. **Resource Risks**: Skills availability, timeline pressure, budget constraints

### Risk Scoring

- **Probability**: 1 (Rare) to 5 (Almost Certain)
- **Impact**: 1 (Negligible) to 5 (Catastrophic)
- **Risk Score**: Probability × Impact (1-25)

### Risk Levels

- **Low Risk**: 1-5 (Green)
- **Medium Risk**: 6-12 (Yellow)
- **High Risk**: 13-19 (Orange)
- **Critical Risk**: 20-25 (Red)
