# COBOL Migration Demo â€“ Documentation Generation

This repository contains the artifacts generated during the demo of migrating a COBOL system to a modern stack.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

* **`Legacy_App/`**
  The original COBOL legacy project. Serves as the main source for analysis and migration reference.

* **`prompts/`**
  Prompts used to generate documentation automatically from COBOL code and the custom parser.

* **`documentation/`**
  Documentation generated with AI assistance and a custom COBOL parser. Includes both functional and technical descriptions of the system.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how automated parsing and AI-driven prompts can be combined to:

1. Understand the structure and business functions of a legacy COBOL system.
2. Produce clear, navigable, and useful documentation for modernization projects.
3. Lay the groundwork for progressive migration to current technologies.
